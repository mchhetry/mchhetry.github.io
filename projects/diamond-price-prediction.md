# Diamond Price Prediction

## Objective
To predict the price of diamonds based on their features (e.g., carat, cut, color, clarity, and depth) using machine learning techniques.

## Role
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Feature engineering and selection.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Process
1. Collected and cleaned diamond dataset.
2. Performed exploratory data analysis to understand relationships between features.
3. Engineered new features (e.g., price per carat).
4. Built and evaluated regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
5. Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, R²).

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

## Outcome
- Achieved an R² score of 0.95 on the test dataset.
- Identified key features influencing diamond prices (e.g., carat, cut, and clarity).
- Deployed the model as a web application using Flask.
